# DIYino
An Arduino compatible integrated circuit board for prop electronics.

Goal of this particulat Git is to collect information about the Board, but I will also include snippets of code I write which helps better deal with the DIYino board
like test code, calibration code for used chipsets, known-working lightsaber code etc.
