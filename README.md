# DIYino Prime
An Arduino compatible integrated circuit board for prop electronics.

Goal of this particulat Git is to collect information about the Board, but I will also include snippets of code I write which helps better deal with the DIYino board
like test code, calibration code for used chipsets, known-working lightsaber code etc.

THANK YOU !!!

Thanks to Sebastien Capou (neskweek) for writing the first professional LightSaber code called LSOS (see link below)
Thanks to Jacob Martin (Jakesoft) from Arduino Forum for his initial idea of using Arduino device to build a lightsaber and many more source of inspirations. Thanks to him also for his USaber library which is fully compatible to DIYino Prime.
